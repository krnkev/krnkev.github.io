  When I first graduated highschool, I wanted to be an entrepeneur in the field of electrical engineering. One of the ideas that I came up with was a type of tint that you could turn on and off. It was inspired by the big glass windows on all the new high rises that I saw during my trips to Honolulu. After doing some research I found out that this tint was a preexisting technology. With a few friends I tried to start a company that would install this tint on windows for houses and condos.
  
  We came across major roadblocks however. After our first few installs, we realised that we needed a certified electritian to install the tint, and we also needed approval from the Hawaiian electric company. Slowly this idea for our company faded away...
  
  I was still interested in this technology however. A short while later, I came up with an idea to improve on the existing electrochromic tint. Currently, the smarttint was being installed as a single large film that was placed on the window. My idea was to cut the film into long thin strips with each individual strip wired and controlled separately, and having those strips controlled by a centralized microcontroller which could control the output voltage of the strips, thus controlling the amount of tint each strip had. The goal was to be able to "open" the strips of film much like how someone would open a regular curtain. This included being able to partially open the e-curtain, with the slide of your finger from an app such as your phone, or a wall mounted controller. I even thought of an idea where the e-curtain could have a mode which mimicked wind blowing a regular curtain, which had the strips slowly fade in and out at different time intervals. 
  
  I think that there is a place for this idea in the future. The e-curtain can lower heating and ventilation costs due to the uv protective nature of the elements contained within the tint itself, and also elinates dust that a normal curtain would create and be easier to clean.
  
  This project is curerntly ongoing. One of the major setbacks currently, is that if the tint strips are all set on a single window, the voltage from the strips interfere with eachother causing the e-curtain to malfunction.
