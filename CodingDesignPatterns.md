Many things that require skill and knowledge in life have a set way or pattern of doing them, which can be considered to be the "best way" to do them. This simply means that the structure and order of how these tasks are accomplished lead to a more organized, efficient, and overall publicly accepted methodolgy of completing said task.

For example, let's look at a golf swing. To maximize power, consistency, and accuracy, and also to lower injury risk, there is a set form for a golf swing that is taught and accepted by the golfing community at any skill level. This involves the proper placement of feet, hand grip positioning, body angle, and much more. The proper form for the golf swing also varies depending on what club you are using, which usually means you are trying to accomplish a different task on the golf course. For example, the standard golf swing while driving the ball will be vastly different from the swing while putting the ball. 
Usually swings that stray too far from the standard golf swing lead to inconsistency, injury, and bad habits. These are referred to as improper techniques, are examples of bad patterns.

Although varying much more, and being more complicated than a golf swing, coding also has "best ways" to code, called coding "design patterns". Since coding has so many different applications, from web design to security applications, there are just as many design patterns. Those design patterns may or may not be applicable to other coding applications.

I have used design patterns in my recent projects. For example, in several of my projects that utilize the Meteor application, I have utilized the Publish-Subscribe design pattern, which is a design pattern that is very integral to the way Meteor works.

In my coding library, there is a function called "Publish", which is basically a way to provide data to the users that subcribe(request) the data when they access the site. 

In conclusion, design patterns are very valuable to coders. They not only provide a clear infrastructure that is publicly recognized to be the best methodology to approach their coding task, but they also can help others who are trying to understand and alter your code. What is important to know as well however, is not just just realizing there is a coding design pattern for one's task, but understanding the underlying principles behind the design pattern to fully utilize them and apply them in future projects.
