# What a ride this semester has been

From learning about wireless telecommunications infrastructures, to creating my own System on Chip(SoC), the journey that finalized my bachelors degree has been wonderful. 

Among all these things, the software development knowledge that I have learned seem to be the key in my future success if I decide to pursue Software engineering in the future.

One of the major points that have been coded into my brain has been the whole idea of OpenSource development. During my EE 468's research project, I have come to realize that OpenSource development seems to be a key ingredient in the success of many major software projects. This includes big names like Arduino, Apache, and even things like phone applications, where large corporations open up their software to let the world use their interface and programs to develop whatever application or game they want. During ICS 314, I got to experience a little taste of this sort of open source type of develop with a group project. I had 3 other partners, and we all contributed to a single application while maintaining contact with eachother, and reviewing everyone else's commits to the code, while helping eachother at the same time. We all contributed our own bits of code to create something wonderful. I had always thought that coding by myself would be way more efficient, but consolidating minds and code with others seemed to be so constructive that I am looking forward to more projects like this.

I had written a previous essay about coding standards, but I do want to revisit the topic and add on a bit more knowledge that I had gained. One of the coding standards that we as students have applied to our code was called ESlint. ESlint has been an awesome tool in helping us highlight errors and bits of code that did not abide by the ESlint coding standard. For example, if I had two blank spaces in a certain page of code, ESlint would highlight the error and prevent the code from running. It helps enforce proper coding "form", as well as makes it a lot eaasier for others to read, understand, and work on your code. In group coding work, coding standards would be invaluable.

Ethics in software engineering was also a topic that was stressed upon, something that I felt a connection to. I wanted to become an engineer to help people, and/or make people's lives a bit better in this harsh world. I could definitely wield the might of my code to do unethical actions, such as taking advantage of a company that I work for, or to hack into systems and gain information. This is something I would never do however, as I agree with my professors, that engineers have an obligation to remain within ethical boundaries.

These lessons are things that I will always remain conscious of while I pursue my future goals in software engineering and in life in general.
