  A big part of engineering is to try and find the most efficient solution to a given problem. I have always embodied this commonly carried sentiment throughout my early days learning coding and electro-physics. However, there is a clearly defined line between finding the most efficient solution in a proper way where you learn and are productive, and finding the quickest and laziest way out. In my opinion, the difference lies within the end result. Has anything been learned when gleaning the solution? Can the knowledge gained be replicated and reproduced when called upon without help? 
  
  A good reference to this topic is discussed in the essay "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" by Eric Steven Raymond. In this essay, Eric discusses how a professional hacker negatively views people who are always looking for the short and easy way out to a coding problem. According to Eric, it is very obvious to tell when an amateur coder asks a question to simply get it over with. Often times, it also very easy to tell that the person asking the question didn't even bother trying to solve the problem himself, or bother researching on Google. Throughout the rest of the essay, Eric also talks about how to remedy this problem, which is by doing the proper research and being motivated, and also by asking questions the right way when you are actually stuck. A link to Eric's essay is shown below.

  To highlight Eric's solution, I took to StackOverflow.com to find an example of good question asking and bad question asking from people trying to solve coding problems. One of the questions that I found that was a good way to ask a question had to do with Binary Tree construction. The task that the person asking the question was to create a Binary tree with 1,000,000 implemented using recursion. The reason why this is a good example of question asking is because he touches upon many of Eric's points. For example, The question was asked in a brisk, polite, and professional manner. He also showed examples of his actual code, and listed where the bug errors were occuring while he was trying to run his code. This shows that the asker has actively tried to find a solution, and is actually putting in time in effort into his problem. He also states that the problem is not a homework problem, which professional coders don't like to help solve, because the asker of the question doesnt learn anything. The link to this Stackoverflow question is shown below.

    On the other hand, it was very easy to find an example of bad question asking. In this forum, the asker of the question is trying to figure out how to make a basic instant messaging system, while failing at almost every level of good question asking according to Eric. To begin with, the forum was flagged for cancellation due to the vagueness of his question. If a question is too vague, then people will be unable to pinpoint the cause of the problem, thus being unable to solve it. The questions was also asked in an almost childlike and unprofessional-like manner. The asker of the question also has provided no code and almost no reference point, and simply stated that he searched through web without being able to find anything. The laziness and lackadaisacal approach to this problem is clearly shown in the link below.

    To conclude, a successful programmer is not always determined by how efficiently he can solve a problem, especially if the programmer is relying on the strengths and work of others. It is instead determined by other factors such as effort, a longing to improve oneself, and proper question asking.
