The past few weeks has had us dive head first into webdesign, something that I was not too familiar with. I had built websites before, but never from the ground up using HTML. 

I feel like I caught on fairly quickly, and just as fast, I realised how challenging and cumbersome building an aesthetic and professionally functional website could be. Simply creating a website with simple functions such as plain text, or clickable links was simple enough, but when I started having to create navigation bars, and drop down menus in footers things became hectic.

That is when our professor introduced us to Semantic UI, which is basically an extraordinary tool that helps building websites easier. Semantic UI provides us with practical commands to building the more complicated aspects of professional websites like navigation bars and slideshows, similar to the ones shown on popular websites of large coporations.

Semantic UI gives web designers ALL of the design capabilities that are provided by professional webdesign programs such as Shopify but for free. This is a big bonus, but the true benefit lies in the ability to control each and every single aspect of your webpage, whereas programs like Shopify are limited to the layouts and designs that are prebuilt by their designers.

I am greatful to my professor for teaching me about semantic UI frameworks, and also for his rapid fire, learn-by-doing approach. Rebuilding preexisting professional websites has honed my web design skills to a sharp edge.
