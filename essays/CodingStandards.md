What is a Coding Standard? 

Coding standards are basically well defined and standardized styles of coding that are used by an organization or group of programmers. The main purpose of these standards is to improve efficiency and build productive habits in coders, and to also help coders to easily read and manipulate other programmers code due to familiarity. 

My first experience of coding using a coding standard was in my ICS 314 class. In this class, everyone in the class was tasked to build javascript projects on github, and to share the code with our mentor. During these projects, I quickly noticed a pattern. As we began every assignment, part of the requirement was to upload a certain set of files that configured and manipulated our programs to work well with the Intellij IDEA professional and to increase GITHUB access efficiency. The files that needed to be uploaded were exactly the same across the board, so I noticed myself getting faster and faster at uploading the files, the more projects I did. This fact correlates to the idea that coding standards improves efficiency.

I also noticed that I became adept more adept at navigating Github.  As I looked around my own repositories, I was quickly able to recognize all the files and what exactly each one did, for each repository. I would definitely be able to recognize these files on someone from the same organizations projects, as long as they had all followed the same coding standard, and I can imagine that they would be able to do so with my repositories.

My experience led me to quickly believe in the power of Coding Standards and their importance within coding, especiallyin the workplace. In my future career, I believe that QUICKLY adapting to the organization's Coding Standards would be very helpful to me and my success.
