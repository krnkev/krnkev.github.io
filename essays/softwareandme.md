  As my college career draws to an end and I look towards the future, I begin to think about my purpose in the engineering field. What do I want from Computer Engineering? What do all the hours and hours debugging projects and practicing code mean?
  
  When I first started engineering, I always pictured myself like Tony Stark... You know, in my basement building Ironman suits. As I got older, and as I experienced internships, I realised that real engineering isn't quite as spectactular or outlandish, at least in most cases. 
  
  But just because I'm not a genius level coder that can create a nuclear powered weaponized suit of armor with an onboard AI, doesn't mean that I can't help people. I realised that techonology helps people everyday, and that even the smallest differences can have a worldwide impact. My main goal currently for engineering, is to be a part of some kind of project where I can work towards a goal that helps make the world a slightly better place. It could be with renewable energy, perhaps creating a more efficient electric car charging station, or even being part of a group that creates a new app that helps people lose weight. The notion that my work is leading to the betterment of the world, whether it be directly, or indirectly by making things more convenient for people is going to be the key in driving my ambition to getting better at my craft.
  
  One of the things that I learned in school is that technology is growing, and at an alarming rate. It almost seems as if new coding languages are being developed every month. My goal for the future in terms of Software Engineering is gain a bit more mastery over the foundational coding languages, which I consider to be C and Javascript, as well gain a handle on the newer languages such as Python and Ruby. I hope to gain an internship or a job that utilizes these new technology. This will keep things fresh and fun, because I do not want to lose that youthful vigor that I had when I first began this journey into computer engineering.
