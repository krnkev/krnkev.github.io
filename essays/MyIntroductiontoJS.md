  My first experience coding with Javascript began this semester, in Professor Phillip Johnson's CS 314 class. And what an introduction it was. Phillip tasked us to run through 140 separate Javascript exercise modules, where each module was a coding prompt for a specific Javascript command/tool. 
  
  During the course of this exercise, I noticed several things. The first thing I noticed was how similar to the C coding language(my most familiar programming language) it was. In terms of basic logic flow and structure, and general approach to solutions, Javascript and C coding shared many parallels. The second thing I noticed was how different it was. I was a bit shocked to see how many new commands and functions were in Javascript that I had not experienced in C coding(for example "let" command). It gave me insight on how different Javascript was to C, and in general, the differences between two different coding languages were.
  
   I cannot express my opinion on Javascript as of yet. A week of practice with a language is not enough for me to draw any conclusions, however, I do believe that my background with C will become invaluable to me during this process. A quick Google skim led me to some key notes about Javascript. Javascript is the most widely used coding language today, and is most frequently used in web development, applications, and gaming. These are fields and subjects that are interesting to me, and which I hope to work with someday in the future. 
   
   Phillip has timed coding exercises called "WODs", that are available on a weekly basis, and I actually think this is a very practical way to gain expertise in a coding language. I am looking forward to seeing my Javascript mastery grow over the course of the semester, and I have no doubt that it will become a valuable tool in my future endeavors in the field of computer science and computer engineering.
