The department of transportation in Hawaii is currently enforcing testing for all people coming into the state.

My basic idea would be something similar, or to create the infrastructure for something that the UH Manoa faculty could
use, if they ever decide to enforce testing for students here. 

The site would definitely use the meteor template that is provided. It would 

-encorporate a database that is based off of UH Manoa's email database.
-have a sign in feature based off the database
-have a feature where the student can upload documents confirming their testing
-have a page where, after the faculty reviews the documents, could post an "accepted", or "denied", or "in review" status
