Overview:
*The problem*: With the second wave of COVID-19 cases expected to arrive any day now, UHM needs to be prepared to handle an increase in positive COVID-19 cases on campus while still remaining operational. To maximize safety, UHM had launched a user-friendly and simple check-in app called LumiSight UH for students, faculty, and staff to fill out in order to get clearance to come to campus. However, there currently does not exist an app to see the COVID hotspots on campus or for people who get tested positive to get clearance to come back to campus. 

*The solution*: The Get Back To Campus app enables you to login to your phone and determine: 
* Where the COVID hotspot places are where COVID positive people may have been
*


The basic goal of this project is to slowly start creating a system that would allow students to attend UH manoa campus again.

Approach

This app will basically be a database for Covid cases on campus,as well as a tracking system of sorts. 

Students who have tested positive can self report with documentation, as well as establish what classes they were going to, and what areas they frequented. 

There will also be a section of the app that allows students to upload documentation clearing them to return to school, which will show the students pending status. 

The main landing page of the app will be a map of the campus, that shows where the "hot zones" of Covid cases have been. This map will use information provided by the students who have self reported.

Possible Pages include:

* Landing Page showing Map(and possible alerts)

* A general page on how to maintain a clean educational environment, contact information if one feels sick,and accepted testing centers

* Upload page form where students can self report and give documentation/detailed tracking information on their whereabouts on campus

* A status page where students can upload clearance documentation and view their status (pending review, accepted, or denied)
