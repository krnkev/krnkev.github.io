Overview:
The problem: With the second wave of COVID-19 cases expected to arrive any day now, UHM needs to be prepared to handle an increase in positive COVID-19 cases on campus while still remaining operational. To maximize safety, UHM had launched a user-friendly and simple contact-tracing app to monitor those who come to campus. However, for those who test positive, the process of getting back to campus can still be a hassle.   

The solution: The Campus Monitor app will easily monitor documents.

The basic goal of this project is to slowly start creating a system that would allow students to attend UH manoa campus again.




The department of transportation in Hawaii is currently enforcing testing for all people coming into the state.

My basic idea would be something similar, or to create the infrastructure for something that the UH Manoa faculty could
use, if they ever decide to enforce testing for students here. 

The site would definitely use the meteor template that is provided. It would 

-encorporate a database that is based off of UH Manoa's email database.

-have a sign in feature based off the database

-have a feature where the student can upload documents confirming their testing

-have a page where, after the faculty reviews the documents, could post an "accepted", or "denied", or "in review" status
